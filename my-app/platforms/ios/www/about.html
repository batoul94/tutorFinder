            <h4> Who we are: </h4>
            <p>
            TutorFinder is a mobile application that gathers university students and parents who are looking for private tutors. University students can sign up as tutors after passing the verification process whereas the parents can search for nearby tutors.

            <h4> What we do: </h4>
            <p>
            Many parents struggling to find private tutors for their children. University students in other hand struggling to find flexible jobs which doesn’t clash with their timetable. What exactly we do is sorting out the two problems with one comprehensive solution; the TutorFinder App. The TutorFinder App provides a chance for the university students to be tutors and teach whatever subject they are confident in. As for parents, the location based application allow them to find the nearest tutor by using the advanced search criteria. They can search by location, subject, level and price range.
            </p>
            
            <h4> How we began: </h4>
            <p>
            It all began with one problem; we couldn’t find jobs. As students we needed feasible  jobs that fits our timetables. The first idea came after a student union member visited our class asking for volunteers who can help first year students. After a lot of researches and data gathering we discovered the lack of ways for parents to find tutors and decided the best way to reach audiences is through their mobile phones. As computer scientist we shared the vision of building mobile phone application; then the TutorFinder app was born.
